Hello welcome to Linear Regression using Gradient descent
What is cos function and loss function?
Loss Function:
Error for a single feature var 
Cos Function
Average error for all the feature vars

Dependent variable X
Independent variable Y

Linear relationship between X and Y
Y=mX+c
gradient descent algorithm:It object is to find the minimum cos function
